##  **Project Overview**

This repository contains a comparison of SPARKS against conventional attention and VAE control models for predicting hand position. This is an attempt at reproducing part of the figures 3 from A Biologically Inspired Attention Model for Neural Signal Analysis by Skatchkovsky et al. 2024, using NWB dataset from the monkey Han. The analysis demonstrates SPARKS' superiority over control models in predicting monkey hand position from neural activity in the somatosensory cortex.
